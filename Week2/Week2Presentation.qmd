## Today's Plan

- Introduction to Basic Principles of Data Visualization

- Getting Data from Eurostat

- Creating Plots with ggplot2 in R


## Data Visualization

The best data visualizations:

- Are clear and easy to understand

- Focus the viewer's attention on the most important comparisons. 

- Avoid misleading the viewer through problems of perception, presentation, or data validity. 

## Some examples

Mario Draghi, former President of the ECB and former Prime Minister of Italy has just released a report on the state of competitiveness of the EU.  The report contains a number of charts that compare the EU to the US and China.

For each chart:

- What is being compared? How many sets of information are being compared?

- What is the conclusion that we're meant to draw?

- How does it connect to the other charts?

## Trade-offs and strategies

- Showing more information vs. less

- Showing individual observations vs. summary statistics

- One figure vs. multiple figures

## Getting Data from Eurostat

- Eurostat collects and distributes data on the EU. You can see the list of datasets at https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database

- the restatapi package in R allows you to access Eurostat data directly from R.

- pay attention to the level of analysis of the data. Eurostat data is defined by its NUTS level. NUTS 0 is the countries, NUTS 1 is regions within countries, and NUTS 2 is smaller regions.
