## Euro-skepticism is on the rise in Europe.

![Photo from Europe Education](page2.jpg)

As the European Union grows with further enlargement, the need for unity becomes stronger. Without its member states understanding, trusting, and feeling confident in these institutions, the Union becomes fragmented and weak. This is especially relevant in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Distrust in the institutions that are meant to protect citizens act as a threat to everyone involved.

Is there a relationship in trust in these institutions and employment and education rates? If so, more resources should be placed into countries with lower trust levels to legitimize the EU as a policymaker.

```

This figure shows us a wide spread of post-secondary education rates throughout European countries. EU member states with the lowest rates of education include Romania (RO), Hungary (HU), Italy (IT), and Czech Republic (CZ).

```

```{r}

employment2023 <- employment %>%
  filter(
    time == 2023,      
    age == "Y25-59",   
    citizen == "TOTAL",
    sex == "T"        
  )

```

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE

ggplot(employment2023, aes(x = reorder(geo, values), y = values, fill = values)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +

  coord_flip() +  # Flip the coordinates
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Employment Rates in 2023, ages 25-59",
    x = "Percentage",
    y = "Country",
    fill = "Percentage"
  )

```

Employment rates in the surveyed countries are strong, but there are still some that lag behind. Among the lowest employment rates in EU member states include Italy (IT), Greece (EL), Estonia (ES), and Romania (RO).

# View the merged data
head(merged_data)

```

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE

# Load ggplot2 for visualization
library(ggplot2)

# Create the scatterplot with labels
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = values.x, y = values.y)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +  # Scatter points
  geom_text(aes(label = geo), vjust = -0.5, size = 3.5) +  # Add labels for geo
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Secondary Education Attainment vs. Employment (2023)",
    x = "Education Values",
    y = "Employment Values"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()


```

This scatterplot shows a positive relationship between post-secondary education and employment in European countries. This means that as education rates increase, employment rates increase.

We can also see overlap in the countries with lower employment and education rates. Now, let's explore specifics about the relationships between our variables.
