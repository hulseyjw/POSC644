# European Citizenship and Democracy

Welcome! This website explores how the citizens interact with democracy in the European Union (EU). The EU was founded on the principle and value of transparency of democracy. In order to even be considered as a candidate EU country, the regime in your country has to be a democracy. Democracy in the EU is very important, but here we will explore how important it is to EU citizens and how they feel those democratic values are being portrayed in each member state. The EU's commitment to these values ensures that the voices of citizens are heard, fostering a system where the government is accountable, inclusive, and based on the rule of law. Through this framework, the EU aims to strengthen democratic practices across its member states, ensuring that power remains with the people.

For democracy to function efficiently, citizens have to have trust in the governmental institutions and politicians that they elect into office. Citizens have to trust the government will make decisions in the best interest of the citizens and will do so transparently and legitimately. Throughout this website, we will explore the trust in government institutions, the rights of an EU citizen, and how people interact with the principle of democracy and accountability in the EU.
