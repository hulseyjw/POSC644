This graph shows the poverty rates across European Union countries. It showed interesting patterns in how economic disparities manifest regionally. The data highlights that smaller countries often show higher poverty rates, influenced by their smaller population sizes. In these nations, economic inequality and limited redistribution mechanisms can cause a larger proportion of their population to fall below the poverty line compared to larger, more diversified economies. Smaller nations like Latvia and Bulgaria frequently experience higher poverty rates, as their economies are less capable of absorbing economic shocks and often rely on fewer industries. Countries with larger populations, such as Germany and France, generally have more resources and robust welfare systems, leading to lower relative poverty rates.

The graph also shows that countries located along the EU's external borders tend to fall in the middle range of poverty rates. Nations such as Poland, Hungary, and Romania exhibit moderate poverty levels due to transitional economies that have significantly improved since joining the EU but still face structural challenges. These border countries often balance economic development pressures with their role as gateways for trade and migration, impacting their overall poverty metrics.
