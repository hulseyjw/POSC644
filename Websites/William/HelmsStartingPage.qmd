The impact on travel is not just on the nations that people decide to visit, but it also has an affect on the people that visit these countries. Europe is not just a destination that people choose for vacation because it has a lot of historical, educational, and religious site, but also because it provides people with cultural experience that they are not able to experience in their own countries.
