```{r}
#| include=FALSE

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(restatapi)
library(giscoR)
library(sf)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(haven)

```

```{r}
#| include: FALSE 

TB <- read_dta("~/Desktop/Grad School /pols 644 /ZA7807_v1-0-0.dta")
```

```{r}
#| include: FALSE

TB_direction <- TB %>% 
  select(isocntry, q4a) %>% 
  mutate(q4aL = as_factor(q4a))
  
head(TB_direction)
```

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE

  TB_direction %>% 
  filter(q4a==1 |q4a==11 | q4a==3 | q4a==4 | q4a==5, isocntry=="AT"|isocntry=="IT"|isocntry=="FR" | isocntry=="DE") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = isocntry, fill = q4aL)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")+
    labs(title = "What is Important for People to concider when Traveling ", x = "Country", y = "Rate of Imporantance")+
    guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Importancy Catigories"))
```

In this we can see that it can be more important to go to places that offer cultural experiences are of the most important for people to take into account. If the EU is taking its policy steps to restrict traveling people will need to take into more account on why picking a destination is important.
