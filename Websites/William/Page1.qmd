## GDP the Cornerstone the European Market

GDP shows the how much the countries throughout Europe are profiting off different topics. Tourism in Europe in every country plays a significant role in the GDP at both the EU level and at the country level. In this section of the website the goal is to show how each country is affected by tourism at the GDP level. Countries that have a lot of tourism will have a higher GDP related to tourism compared to countries that do not have much tourism.

The map above is show how much the GDP in every European country is affected by tourism. When looking at Greece where it is very very dark orange the GDP is affected heavily by tourism. When talking about the affect on the total GDP it is clear that countries in the south are affected significantly more than northern countries. This map clearly shows that every every country in the EU GDP is affected by tourism. With the new rules that are in place it could affect the overall GDP of both countries that have a lot of tourism and countries that do not see as much tourism.
