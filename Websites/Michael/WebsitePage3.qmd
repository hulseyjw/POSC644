HOW THE EUROPEAN UNION IS LEADING IN SINGLE MARKET IMPORTS AND THE IMPACT
```

-   This visualization is demonstrating the EU Single Market's total import based trade within the common economic zone and its relation to the global economy.

-   I decided to see what the overall development trend has been for the EU Single Market for its imports.

-   It demonstrates that there is a consistent demand for foreign goods as a share of market activity.

-   This is caused by a growing internal consumer demand for products from foreign trading partners.

-   Further more, this displays how the Single Market is capable of being a major global economic regional power that allows for its member states to have collective benefit to international trade.

    HOW DOES THIS IMPACT EU CITIZENS AND THEIR ECONOMIC ACITIVITY WITHIN THE SINGLE MARKET?

-   This visualization gives insight into how the Single Market is able to consistently develop increased trade and thus provide increased consumer variety and choice

-   The Single Market is able to because of its collective trade practices, offer a superior range of imports to be provided

-   This in turn allows for higher internal economic growth as a result of greater consumer demand for goods as a share of imports

-   Overall, this further enhances the Single Market as a preferable trading partner and economic entity to maintain and increase future trade relations

-   This is a positive impact for EU citizens, across all member states that enjoy such trade access
