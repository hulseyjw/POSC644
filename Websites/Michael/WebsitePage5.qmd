EU CITIZEN PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT THE SINGLE MARKET'S TRADE POLICIES AND ITS EFFECTS
```

-   This visualization is demonstrating the opinions of EU citizens about trade and EU trade policy.

-   As a matter of policy that impacts the public, the EU Single Market has substantial effects.

-   This is a result of how the trade policies pursued and applied can shift citizen attitudes.

-   When reviewing the relationship between EU citizen opinions about Single Market trade, there is a trend of any increase in import costs and reduction of exports being negatively viewed.

    HOW THIS CAN INFER FOR THE EU's TRADE POLICIES FOR IMPACTING PUBLIC OPINION

-   Citizens of the EU Single Market being adversely impacted by trade policies are a concern.

-   The EU's legitimacy as claiming a democratic mandate for its various institutions and policies, is either helped or harmed depending on how for the specific issue of trade citizens think and feel.

-   This has potential political ramifications for those involved with EU Single Market regulations.

-   As can be demonstrated, the collective economic unity of member states and citizen socio-economic well being is dependent on if the factors of Single Market trade is more beneficial.

-   If particular trade policies are perceived as negative by EU citizens, then there is cause for concern that the Single Market will suffer from Eurosckepticism and Economic Nationalism.

-   This threatens the internal harmony and collective benefit of the Single Market's purpose and continued existence as a unified economic bloc and the accompanying positive attributes.
