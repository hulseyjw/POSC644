THE EUROPEAN UNION'S TRADE TRAJECTORY FOR EXPORTS AND THE IMPACT FOR CITIZENS

-   This visualization is demonstrating the overall export based trade for the EU Single Market and its member states as a common economic zone with its international trade relations.

-   I decided to see what the overall development trend has been for the EU Single Market for its export led growth.

-   It appears that there is a pattern of steady growth for the demand of EU goods.

-   This is a result of an increase in the quantity of international trading partners.

-   This is very important to understand how the Single Market is evolving as a macroeconomic system and how that impacts its member states and their populations.

    WHAT DOES THIS VISUALIZATION MEAN AND WHAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM IT?

-   This visualization is key to understanding why the EU's Single Market is so critical to the EU's survival as a Supranational polity.

-   The member states of the EU are benefited massively from being able to have direct and standardized access to an internal Single Market.

-   This cross border economic integration and unity, allows for a far greater degree of lower cost trade for goods and accompanying services.

-   The EU Single Market facilitates the best means for member states to collectively prosper.

-   This is accomplished by ensuring a robust model which targets export growth.
