AUTHOR

Adrienne Livingston

The term "femicide," the murder of women, is becoming a term used more and more often. The rates of femicide around the world are growing. In the EU, the amount of women killed in 2022 reached 2016 levels which was 4.3 per million women, according to the European Commission. In comparison, the rate of male homicides is 1.9 per million men. Is the EU taking the initiative to reduce these homicides and protect its women, or will women have to continue to suffer before action is taken?
