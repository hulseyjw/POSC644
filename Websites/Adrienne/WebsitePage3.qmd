## Victimology

##### As these graphs, based on [Eurostat data,](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/crim_hom_vrel$defaultview/default/table?lang=en) will show, most of these women know their attackers and had a previous relationship with them. Often these crimes are preceded by domestic abuse that gradually escalates. These perpetrators are serial abusers who will not stop before the woman is either dead or they are in prison. That is why it is of the utmost importance that these crimes are given the appropriate attention and are prosecuted to the highest extent of the law. This is what the [Directive on Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/05/07/council-adopts-first-ever-eu-law-combating-violence-against-women/) is working towards. However, there is always more work to be done.

###### Studies have found that a woman is killed every ten minutes by their intimate partner. As previously stated, this number may seem high but underreporting hides the reality of violence against women. According to the United Nations Regional Information Centre for Western Europe, "in Europe, 64% of femicides are committed by the woman’s intimate partner. This is the highest number globally."
