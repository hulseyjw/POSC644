## Throughout the European Union...

##### The growing influx of immigrants into member state communities has EU citizens feeling mixed emotions about the rising populations. Member states have differing opinions on the rising levels of recent immigrants depending on how their country is affected by the growing population. When more people are in the job market, it lowers the work opportunities for everyone.

#####  In a Eurobarometer survey, participants were asked to name their biggest concerns regarding the future of the European Union. There were 7 issues mentioned most by participants. Immigration was one of the top 7. The four following member states mentioned immigration most frequently as their most pressing concern for the future of the EU.
