## Job Opportunities are Critical for Recent Immigrants

#### Member states of the European Union have seen a recent serge of immigrants joining their communities. For the success of integrating recent immigrants into member states, it is important for housing, schooling, and employment opportunities to be available.

This graph shows the percentage of recent immigrants that have been employed in the year 2022 across EU member states. The graph is divided between female and male immigrants. From the graph, we can observe that more males have been employed than females, but not by a strikingly large percentage.

## What job opportunities provide...

Job opportunities provide monetary stability for recent immigrants, making it easier to settle into their new communities. With economic stability, comes peace of mind and the opportunity to join in community activities in other ways. Recent immigrants benefit from having options as to how they can positively contribute to their new area's economy and social community. Furthermore, having a stable income allows for their families and themselves to have happy and healthy lives.
