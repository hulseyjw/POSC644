Geeks for Geeks. 2023. “Employment: Meaning, Importance, Basic Terms of Employment and Participation of people in Employment.” GeeksforGeeks. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/employment-meaning-importance-basic-terms-of-employment-and-participation-of-people-in-employment/.

Throughout Europe, there has been a steady increase in the employment rate of recent graduates. However, not every European country has seen an increase. For example, Czechia, Estonia, and Montenegro have seen a decrease in the total employment rate of recent graduates. This is different from Lithuania, Latvia, Ireland, and Turkey, which have all seen significant increases in the total employment rates of recent graduates.

It is important to study employment rates and what countries are doing to increase their levels of employment. This allows countries with struggling employment rates to learn what other countries' best practices are so that they can implement successful strategies within their own countries and increase employment rates.

This [dataset](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/edat1_esms.htm) measures the change in employment rates over time in different European countries. Each graph represents a different country that is labeled with the country's abbreviation. The graphs measure changes in employment rates in 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2022. These graphs measure the total employment rates of the whole population. This graph allows governments and policymakers to see which countries have been able to increase their employment rates. By studying which countries have had effective policies that have increased employment, countries with decreasing levels of employment will be able to see what has worked and what they could potentially implement within their own countries.

        ) +

This graph uses the same dataset as above, but it only measures changes in female employment levels in European countries.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
#| echo: false 
#| warning: false 
    filter(RecentGradEmploymentRates, time=="2012" | time=="2016" | time=="2020" | time=="2022", sex=="M") %>% 
      group_by(geo) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=time, y=values, group=geo, color=geo)) +
  geom_line() +
    geom_point() + 
      labs(title="Change in Employment Rates in European Countries Over Time", 
           x="Time", 
           y="Percentage") +
facet_wrap(~geo) +
    theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), 
          axis.title.y=element_blank(),
          axis.text.x=element_blank(),
          axis.ticks = element_blank()
        ) +
      guides(color="none") +
      theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

These graphs use the same dataset, but it measures changes in employment rates of men.
